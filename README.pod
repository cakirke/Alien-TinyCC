=head1 Alien::TinyCC

A Perl Alien module for the Tiny C Compiler. This Perl distribution
distributes and contains the build steps necessary to ensure that the
Tiny C Compiler is available on your system.

=head1 INSTALLATION

I assume that if you are installing this module, you are doing so from
CPAN. The usual Module::Build incantation shold work:

 perl Build.PL
 ./Build
 ./Build test
 ./Build install

On Windows, you should omit the C<./> part of the C<Build> commands.

=head1 DEVELOPMENT

If you want to work on Alien::TCC itself, be sure to not only clone the
repository but also clone the F<src/> directory, i.e. the tcc source
repository. Thus on your command line, you should say something like this:

 git clone https://github.com/run4flat/Alien-TinyCC.git
 cd Alien-TinyCC
 git submodule init
 git submodule update

Since I have a hard time keeping the F<Changes> file up-to-date, I wrote a git
pre-commit hook that checks that I updated the Changes file and double-checks
with me in case I did not. This hook is included in the repo. To enable it in 
your clone, just copy the hook to your F<.git/hooks/> directory like so:

 # Optional; helps keep the Changes file up-to-date
 cp git-commit-hook.pl .git/hooks/pre-commit    # Unixen
 copy git-commit-hook.pl .git/hooks/pre-commit  # Windows
